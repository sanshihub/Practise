Summary of Bucketing in Apache Spark

Bucketing is an optimization technique in Spark used for handling high cardinality columns (columns with a large number of distinct values). It improves query performance by organizing data into predefined buckets.

Benefits of Bucketing

1. Faster Data Retrieval â€“ Spark skips irrelevant buckets, reducing search space.


2. Join Optimization â€“ Helps in efficient joining of large datasets.



How to Use Bucketing?

Bucketing is applied while writing data to disk using bucketBy():

mydataframe_df.write \
    .format("csv") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .bucketBy(4, "column_name") \
    .saveAsTable("Database_name.Table_name")

Here, bucketBy(4, "column_name") creates 4 buckets based on the column values.


How Bucketing Works?

If we bucket an ID column (1 to 100) into 4 buckets, records are distributed as:

B1: 1-25

B2: 26-50

B3: 51-75

B4: 76-100


If we query id=60, Spark directly fetches B3, skipping B1, B2, and B4, thus improving performance.


Difference Between Bucketing and Partitioning

Partitioning: Data is split into physical files stored in HDFS.

Bucketing: Uses a hash function to distribute records into a fixed number of buckets within a managed table.


This makes bucketing better for high-cardinality columns where defining partitions dynamically is inefficient.
